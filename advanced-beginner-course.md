1. Advance beginner formula

# Context, choose language framework, Go to irc, GitHub commits
- Just read 10 tutorials, let brain connect dots, immerse, forum, Reddit, watch conference videos(experts)
- Like Elon meet with a group of experts when he want to go to new area
- Everyday click web dev talking type videos, don’t eve know what it means

# do 25 tutorials, consistently
- Don’t learn 100 language, learn 1 language with 1000 tutorials, that’s going to FAANG
- do things nothing want, 2 percent of them do 50 tutorial. To prolific. Fuck negative thinking. repeat 
- Pick one language, get hired, and learn new language in job. Must stick to one language. 

# Project: 2-3 projects every step, like in job place.
-draw it out
-Deconstruct into sub tutorials
-Identify what tutorial it looks like, break down into
-Execute tutorial
-combine tutorials to one applications

Best with mentor, how to do project like in day job. Find Twitter, DM them I got few question, see your profiles, I’ve got few queries. I am working on a project. Can you give me a step by step checklist you go through at your day job? 5 to 10 checklist items.
-use version control
-create new repo
-create new rails app, specify database
...
-identify what you want to build, go to GitHub, follow high level checklist and do it. Learn git.
-find project online use the framework. design phase, draw boxes.
-send question to mentor, what are common guild-lines that you follow when you start a new ruby project? Look at example, break into tutorials. 
Eg  
homefeed- blog post index part, lookup blog tutorial
Button-look up html tutorials
Search bar- how to do search in mern?
Link- how to make new page in mern?
Just follow until you create the app, reference and ask mentor, develop relationship, constantly ask DM. Put Twitter profile you are student. 
-invest yourself. Get more education. Find Mentor, coach, boot camp. Start job hunting. start interviewing. 
-Use Twitter to dm find mentors. Watch their actions. Find people and model them. Model their actions, don’t model what they say. How they direct business. Been ornstein. Google framework+videos. Look who he is. 
-ignore what everyone say for 10 years, on 10th year you find one person worth listening to and do everything they say.
-stretch advance beginner as far as possible. Organic career

# get out of advance beginner
-Massive amount of hours into programming. Don’t ask dumb question. One step forward. Thing work themself out. You do the work. You deserve it. Put in the fucking hours no matter what.


2. how to learn code fast?
Learn from subconsciousness


3. critical thinking
-extreme ownership, never any excuse. There ain’t no excuses. Own your life. Own your mistakes.
-fixed vs growth mindset
-Your brain seeks a game. Give your brain the right game to play. Powerful than superPC.
-**You cannot focus on any negative thing if you want extraordinary results.** only focus on things you want. Put your mind on them and you get it. Stop settle for second best. Only settle on one thing based on your potential.
-evolutional mismatch. 本能不一定是对的，过去的时候人类为了生存而不做冒险的事情，冒险会被踢出族群处于危险境地。但现在2022只有通过挑战，才能提高。硬刚，一旦你逃避，逃避的事会成为心魔永远横在你的面前，阻止你，所以必须硬刚。 take challenge and your subconscious realign.

-don’t write more code, read more, books, codes, change ur mind model.


4. how to learn javascript? - at least try for a week
- Dont see implementation, pick one framework and one language. React(lib) + Redux. Do 10 tutorial. After 5-10 tutorial your brain put stuff together, aha moment. process intermentation

- start, open browser, type tutorial by hand, no copy pasting. Do tutorials like its a fun hobby, do with detached focus, can't stress. 5 is for fun, pleasing tutorials.

- after done 5, go back and see and look up things. E.g. look up MVC, go to youtube, image, visualizing is faster.

- start watching conference videos. JS conference videos, talks. watch every single one. Dont even need to focus. Detach focus. Dont worry you dont understand.
